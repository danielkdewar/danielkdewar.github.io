      <description>There is no such thing as a natural death: nothing that happens to a man is ever natural, since his presence calls the world into question. All men must die: but for every man his death is an accident and, even if he knows it and consents to it, an unjustifiable violation.
 I have thought about death for as long as I can remember. Not dying. Death. I have no desire to die although one day I will.</description>
